**Summary**

I study at university since 2018 and I already want to change my future profession. My goal is to become a good developer, to live in Europe, to learn some languages (I already know English and German a bit) and just be happy, that's why I should throw myself and work hard. 
As a developer I'm learning JS since November and trying to do simple tasks. 

**Skills**

* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* JS
* BEM 

**Education**

**Languages**

I've been learning English since elementary school. My listening, reading skills are good enough and I need more practice with writing and speaking.
